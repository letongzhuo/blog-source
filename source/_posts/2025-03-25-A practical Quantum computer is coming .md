### [Segment 1: Quantum Computing Basics]  
This is a chip manufacturing tool. This is the biggest [molecular beam epitaxy](https://yuanbao.tencent.com/bot/app/share/chat/dJ7utCwvhKOv) tool in the world as far as we know. And this tool is making a very special material that we need to realize any kind of useful quantum computer.  

### [Segment 2: Industry Players]  
California-based startup, Psi quantum is one of the many companies working to make large-scale quantum computing a reality. We are inside the Stanford Linear accelerator cryo plant that makes liquid helium. And Psiquantum is using a little bit of that helium.  

### [Segment 3: Cooling Process]  
And what we do is we load chips into this [cabinet](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/cabinet) to cool those chips to very low temperature. So this is -270Â°C. It's about 2.3 Kelvin base temperature, which is the same temperature as deep space.  

### [Segment 4: Quantum Potential]  
Quantum computers promise to solve problems that are impossible for traditional computers, with the potential to transform entire sectors, including materials science, pharmaceutical research, and financial services. Investors have also been bullish about the technology's future, with some quantum computing stocks rallying over 1,000% in 2024.  

### [Segment 5: Investor Focus]  
If investors are looking for the next big jackpot. It sounds like they're really focusing attention on quantum computing stocks.  

### [Segment 6: Tech Breakthroughs]  
Excitement around quantum computing reached a fever pitch after Google announced its Willow quantum chip at the end of last year. By our best estimates, a calculation that takes Willow under five minutes, would take the fastest supercomputer 10 to the 25 years. Or a time scale way longer than the age of the universe.  

### [Segment 7: Corporate Competition]  
Since then, a slew of other announcements from other tech giants have sustained that hype around and investment in the technology. Microsoft, announcing what it calls a quantum computer breakthrough with its new Marjorana 1 chip. Amazon jumping into the quantum computing race with its first chip.  

### [Segment 8: Research Expansion]  
We're going to open a quantum research lab in Boston. It will likely be the most advanced accelerated computing hybrid quantum computing research lab in the world. Intel and IBM are also working to develop quantum technology, as are governments and numerous startups.  

### [Segment 9: Global Recognition]  
The United Nations has even proclaimed 2025 as the International Year of Quantum Science. It's a new class of computation that I think can dramatically change most aspects of industry, commerce, and science.  

### [Segment 10: Funding Commitments]  
By some estimates, greater than $50 billion have been pledged to quantum technologies, of which quantum computing is one, by governments around the world.  

### [Segment 11: Current Limitations]  
Despite massive advancements in the field in recent years, right now... These quantum computers are not able to solve the big real world problems. It's still more theoretical.  

### [Segment 12: Historical Context]  
The theory of quantum computing has been around since the 1980s, when physicists first suggested that quantum mechanics could be used for computation. By taking advantage of quantum physics, quantum computers are able to produce huge leaps in processing power and solve problems that conventional computers simply cannot manage.  

### [Segment 13: Core Principles]  
There are two really important special quantum mechanical properties that give quantum computers an advantage on classical computers in solving certain types of problems. The first is called superposition, the second is entanglement.  

### [Segment 14: Qubit Mechanics]  
Unlike classical computers, which store information in bits, with each bit representing either a 1 or a 0, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in superposition of 1 and 0, meaning they hold multiple possibilities simultaneously.  

### [Segment 15: Entanglement Effects]  
Qubits can also be entangled where the state of one instantaneously affects the other, no matter the distance. These properties enable quantum computers to solve certain types of problems exponentially faster than classical systems.  

### [Segment 16: Simulation Advantages]  
Unlike classical computers, quantum computers can directly simulate that behavior, and that allows us to design things instead of just discover things. All our drugs we've gone into the Amazon, we've pulled bark off trees, we've seen how many mice die, and we've tried to make an oncology drug just by guessing and trying to optimize around stuff we discover.  

### [Segment 17: Material Design]  
But being able to design materials directly to be able to design chemistry drugs, catalysts requires a tool where we can simulate nature. And the quantum computers are the first ones that can actually do that.  

### [Segment 18: Agricultural Applications]  
Quantum computers could also help with agriculture. The way fertilizer is produced today comes at a really steep cost for companies. They're spending about 100 to $300 billion a year. And for the environment, 3 to 5% of the world's natural gas is annually used for fertilizer synthesis.  

### [Segment 19: Computational Challenges]  
Scientists today, know how to use computers in order to find a much more energy efficient alternative. The problem is, it would take even the fastest supercomputer 800,000 years to simulate all the maze-like molecular interactions of the key catalyst. With a quantum computer, could be less than 24 hours.  

### [Segment 20: Complementary Technologies]  
But quantum computers will not replace conventional computers for everything. Some sectors could benefit more from the technology than others. It won't replace AI. They are complementary technologies.  

### [Segment 21: Industry Impact]  
Analysts estimate that the four industries likely to see the earliest economic impact from quantum computing are mobility, chemicals, financial services and life sciences, which stand to gain up to $2 trillion in value by 2035.  

### [Segment 22: Corporate Partnerships]  
Psi quantum says it's already working with a number of enterprise partners to experiment with potential use cases. We're working with a bunch of different companies, so Boehringer Ingelheim, for instance, a large European pharmaceutical company. Mercedes-benz, Mitsubishi Chemical and various other fortune 500 companies as customers and partners.  

### [Segment 23: Technical Hurdles]  
Ironically, the same quantum properties that make quantum computers really good at processing complex problems also make the technology extremely difficult to work with. Unlike classical bits, which are physically stable and robust, qubits exist in highly delicate quantum states, and these states are easily perturbed by even the smallest interactions with the external environment.  

### [Segment 24: Environmental Interference]  
Things like thermal noise, electromagnetic interference, vibrations, acoustic noise. The other challenge is that quantum superposition is ephemeral. So superposition allows qubits to represent multiple states at once. But maintaining this state requires precise isolation from the environment.  

### [Segment 25: Engineering Dilemma]  
Think of coherence as a way of keeping a quantum system stable so that it can run calculations. The whole difficulty of constructing a quantum computer is making something that, on the one hand, cannot interact with anything, right? On the other hand, you can control it, but controlling it means it's interacting with something, right? So it's like this very, very difficult engineering problem.  

### [Segment 26: Technological Approaches]  
Quantum companies have been experimenting with different quantum technologies, each with its own drawbacks and benefits. There are superconducting qubits. There are neutral atom qubits. There are trapped ion qubits. And then there are other qubits, which you see a little bit less industrially.  

### [Segment 27: Corporate Strategies]  
Google, IBM, Amazon, and Rigetti computing are all betting on superconducting qubits, while Xanadu and Psi quantum use photonic qubits. In February, Microsoft announced that it had created a quantum computing chip, Majorana 1 that uses a new type of qubit known as a topological qubit.  

### [Segment 28: Innovation in Qubits]  
The technology required the creation of a new state of matter that could make quantum computers more resilient to noise and shorten the technology's development timeline from decades to years.  

### [Segment 29: Error Management]  
The sensitivity of qubits to external environmental factors also makes quantum systems very prone to error. For many qubit technologies, managing this error has meant having to keep quantum chips at extremely low temperatures.  

### [Segment 30: Cooling Infrastructure]  
The icon of quantum computing is the chandelier. That system is all about cooling these chips to very, very low temperatures. And so they have to run deep space temperature, liquid helium temperature, very, very cold.  

### [Segment 31: Error Correction]  
Errors are also mitigated through the use of special algorithms that allow experts to correct errors faster than the machine can make them. This is something Google demonstrated with its Willow chip.  

### [Segment 32: Scaling Challenges]  
The Willow chip effectively operates below what's called the surface code threshold. Historically, when technology providers have added more qubits to the system, the overall system has a higher total error rate.  

### [Segment 33: Photonic Advantages]  
Peter Barrett, whose venture capital firm is a major investor in Psi quantum, says that while Google and the other tech giants have made huge strides in quantum technology, he believes quantum computers based on photonic qubits like the ones used by Psi quantum, are more practical to scale.  

### [Segment 34: System Design]  
Part of that strategy, Psiquantum is also moving away from the classic chandelier design of quantum computers in favor of a server rack design that you typically find in a data center. Generally, the approach that we have here at quantum is that as much as possible, we want to build the quantum computer like a conventional computer as opposed to a science experiment.  

### [Segment 35: Manufacturing Partnerships]  
In February, Psi quantum unveiled Omega, a quantum photonic chip that the company says contains all the components necessary to build utility-scale quantum computing. The chips are manufactured by New York-based Global Foundries.  

### [Segment 36: Workforce Shortage]  
Another major barrier to scaling quantum computers is the lack of a highly technical workforce needed to design, program, and run quantum systems. Currently, the talent pool is just far too small to meet the demands of the growing industry.  

### [Segment 37: AI Integration]  
One way to overcome this talent problem may be by using more computers and leaning on artificial intelligence. Already we're using large language models, IBM, I think, was the first company to pioneer this, in order to actually supplement developer knowledge bases and allow Llms to program quantum computers.  

### [Segment 38: Mutual Benefits]  
But it goes both ways. AI development could also benefit from quantum computers. There are great AI tools that can help with designing some aspects of quantum computers, and once you have a quantum computer, you can produce training data to train AIs.  

### [Segment 39: Practical Challenges]  
The potential of quantum computers to solve some of the world's hardest problems, like coming up with new drugs or materials for more efficient electric batteries has many people excited. But its challenges like this that have led some of the world's most influential technology pioneers to temper expectations about just how close we are to a useful quantum computer.  

### [Segment 40: Timeline Estimates]  
If you kind of said 15 years for a very useful quantum computers, that would that would probably be on the early side. If you said, you know, 30 is probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.  

### [Segment 41: Market Reactions]  
Following Huang's remarks, the market was quick to react. Shares of quantum computing stocks having a volatile start to the year after a steep run up in late 2024. Many are now down double digits in 2025. And concerns about just how soon the technology might be commercially viable.  

### [Segment 42: Technical Consensus]  
We agree with Jensen, of course, that quantum computing is not here yet, and really the basis for his comments is that today there are small quantum processors. Google's system, for instance, that's about 100 qubit system. The general consensus is that you need about a million qubits to really deliver on these world changing applications.  

### [Segment 43: Industry Dialogue]  
At Nvidia's annual software developer conference in March, Huang gave quantum experts a chance to prove his timeline wrong. This is the first event in history where a company where a company CEO invites all of the guests to explain why he was wrong.  

### [Segment 44: Comparative Development]  
We think of ourselves as like ten years where you were ten years ago. It's going to be another 10 to 15 years to get to where Nvidia and all the other giants are.  

### [Segment 45: Scientific Skepticism]  
But the complexity of quantum computing has generated controversy around some of the achievements in the field. For example, some experts and competitors are questioning Microsoft's topological qubits breakthrough that the company said would help it build a working quantum computer in a matter of years.  

### [Segment 46: Research Validation]  
Microsoft's research published in Nature in February, though the company said in an emailed statement that it submitted the paper almost a year prior, and during that time, Microsoft has made "tremendous progress."  

### [Segment 47: Physics Exploration]  
The exotic physics that Microsoft is pursuing is incredibly exciting, but it's a step along a journey that will ultimately yield something useful, but it's unclear when. Microsoft said discourse and skepticism are part of the scientific process, and that additional data will be shared in the coming weeks.  

### [Segment 48: Near-Term Prospects]  
Although quantum computing may not be ready for prime time today, tangible progress is being made. I do think there are going to be results this year, that hint towards real quantum utility for commercial applications.  

### [Segment 49: Ancillary Innovations]  
Technology that started off as a quantum computing modality is now being used to make ordinary MRI machines 100,000 times more sensitive and allow them to directly image cancer metabolism. Technologies to see two kilometers underground. To find the critical minerals for the energy transformation. That's already happened.  

### [Segment 50: Future Outlook]  
And then the prize of the really big machines, the million qubit machines we know is only a handful of years away. Public interest in quantum technology is growing. The number of quantum computing proof of concept enterprise projects surged by 50% between 2022 and 2024, to over 150 active projects.  

### [Segment 51: Investment Momentum]  
Consulting firm Booz Allen, Airbus Ventures and Bosch Ventures have all invested in quantum computers. Meanwhile, Shadbolt says Illinois is investing $500 million to construct a quantum computing campus in Chicago, of which Psi quantum will be the anchor tenant.  

### [Segment 52: Global Projects]  
Psi quantum has also received $620 million from the Australian and Queensland governments to build a utility-scale quantum computer in Brisbane, which the company says will be operational by the end of 2027.  

### [Segment 53: Strategic Timing]  
Experts say, investing now is a smart move. When quantum computers reach quantum advantage, which is effectively the period in which quantum computers outperform classical computers at important real world problems, it will be much, much harder to get your hands on a quantum computer unless you're developing partnerships with the major providers right now.  

### [Segment 54: Imperfect Utility]  
Plus, Langione adds, quantum computers don't need to be perfect to be useful. We had practical implications for classical computers before classical computers were error corrected. Whether computers were doing atomic simulations for the Manhattan Project, they were doing important work for the Census Bureau.  

### [Segment 55: Historical Parallels]  
We think that there's a potential for the same thing in quantum computing. And candidly, we're even looking to the next 12 to 18 months for the announcement of the first example of Industrial quantum advantage that would come before error correction. And then 2029 is when we think the real inflection could come in terms of massive value creation for end users in the right industry.  

### [Segment 56: Optimistic Perspective]  
Shadbolt is also optimistic. You know, when I arrived in Silicon Valley eight years ago, a lot of people, really serious technical people, told me that self-driving cars would never happen in my lifetime. Too complicated, too difficult. And of course, now every other car that we see in San Francisco is a Waymo.  

### [Segment 57: Technological Trajectory]  
And so quantum computing has a similar sort of trajectory. What we're seeing now is a big leap to go from the small systems that we have today, to the very, very large systems that are required for any kind of useful application.
