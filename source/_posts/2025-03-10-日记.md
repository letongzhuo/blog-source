 - 今天起了个大早，5点就起来了，5点半到学校，然后跑了半个小时步，中午也没回去躺，不错，希望能坚持。
- 我像一个反复横跳的跳梁小丑，被冠以背叛的标签，好伤心
- 有的人因为看见而相信，有的人因为相信而看见，很不巧我是前者，没有远见卓识
- “我打算去死”“**扛！死扛！！**”

I'm trying to write English diary to improve my level , so i will make it as possible as i can
 - today i get up very early about five o'clock ,then i get to school, really clam down there's no one but me , i keep on running half of one hour at playground. hahaha, i didn't go back to my rental house , not bad , hope i can keep going on, don't give up , come on, man , you've got this 
 - I'm so sad about the label of betray what my closed friend called me, cause i decide to prepare to take part in the Postgraduate Admission test
 - someone decides to believe before seeing , and someone decides to see before believing , I don't happen to be one of the former group 
 - "I'm going to die ""**Don’t you dare! Keep fighting like your life depends on it!!**"
