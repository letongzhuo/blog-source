#### [Segment 1: Introduction to Speed's incident]  
The real China was just accidentally shown by a famous Youtuber and lifestreamer. People were shocked. I'm BeeRose in China, and I've been living in China for 6 years. I am going to tell you guys about things that I have never heard any other people talking about online. So make sure to stick around until the end, because I have some shocking things to tell you. Let's jump right into it.  

#### [Segment 2: Speed's background and viral moment]  
The Youtuber's name is Speed, and he is one of the most popular internet personalities. He is only 20 years old, he's an American. He's very energetic and fun to watch, and he has an IRL series—or in real life series—where he goes around to different countries and live streams. He just so happens to be in China right now. Speed went viral in China due to his reaction to a Chinese song. When he listened to this song, he heard a word repeated over and over again that sounds a lot like the N-word. He screamed, he yelled, he freaked out, he slammed his fist on the desk. I mean, he just went totally wild.  

#### [Segment 3: Cultural misunderstanding explained]  
But actually, ironically, this song is a really pure and nice song. It's about how wonderful we are, and the word that was used literally just means "that" in Chinese. It is so common to hear this. When I first moved here, I heard it so often, and I was like, "Oh my gosh, what are they saying?" But this word is used as a filler word, just like in English we use "um" or "like."  

#### [Segment 4: Livestream reception and infrastructure]  
He was in Shanghai just a few days ago, and right now he's in Beijing. But I'm gonna talk about the Shanghai live stream. He live-streamed for over six hours, and over 5 million people have watched it. That's insane. People were shocked because Chinese people were so incredibly nice to Speed and also respectful. It seems like Speed has traveled to many other places—other countries—and people have not been as respectful. I can really feel this too.  

#### [Segment 5: Personal experience in China]  
Six years ago, I moved here, and Chinese people shocked me too. I only knew what the media had told me: that Chinese people were the enemy, and that I couldn't trust China as a whole. But actually, when I came here, I felt so, so welcome. And still to this day, I still feel so welcome. Chinese people are so nice, so inviting, so hospitable. Being in China is amazing as a foreigner. I do have people call me "laowai," but let me tell you—I've said this in another video—they don't mean this in a mean way. They probably have never seen a foreigner before. They're just excited to see me, really.  

#### [Segment 6: Internet accessibility theories]  
Another crazy thing that people commented on was that this livestream was over 6 hours long, and it didn't lag, not even once. I saw so many comments saying this, and it's true: the internet here is amazing. You can find 5G almost anywhere. This is where I'm about to spill the tea to you all, because I already know—I can predict what the comments will be—and that is: "Well, isn't it illegal to access YouTube when you're in China?"  

#### [Segment 7: Government permissions and observations]  
I have a huge feeling that Speed was given the green light by the government to do his live streams. You may be asking, "BRose, how can you be so sure about this?" Well, I have worked at many companies in China, and many of those companies that I've worked for were put on a white list. What do I mean by white list? They were given permission to access the internet beyond the great firewall. The government understands that to do proper business in China, these businesses need to communicate with other Western people, other businesses, other organizations. They know that it is crucial for them to survive, so they give this special permission.  

#### [Segment 8: Urban confidence and infrastructure]  
So the moment that I walked into work and I connected to the internet, I was able to access the internet beyond the great firewall. Of course, I used it just for work purposes because I was super busy. But yeah, this is something I've never seen anybody else talk about on YouTube online. So what do you think about this? If the government truly did give him the green light like I think they did, then this says something huge. This says that the government has absolute faith in the city—and what I mean by that is that, of course, they give him the green light to do the livestream, but they don't surveil where he's going.  

#### [Segment 9: Unrestricted exploration evidence]  
Because I watched the livestream, and he literally went wherever he wanted to go just on a whim. He would go there, there, there—it didn't matter. Whatever he wanted, wherever he wanted to go, they went. This shows that the city is confident in the fact that there are no homeless people, there's not a crazy amount of trash, there are not drugs. Infrastructure is amazing. They will see the real China, which is beautiful.  

#### [Segment 10: Unofficial permission implications]  
On the flip side, if they did not give him permission, then this also says something really huge—and that is, they gave him unofficial permission to do so. Because let me tell you, in China—especially Beijing—they know exactly what's going on. This is the capital; it's very sensitive. They know who is here, they know what they're doing, they know where they're going. If the government wanted to, they could shut down what he's doing like *this* easily. But they're not. So again, this shows that the government has full faith in the city.  

#### [Segment 11: 5G capabilities and comparisons]  
They know that wherever Speed goes, he is going to see the real China, which is beautiful China. It also proves my point more that the internet is absolutely crazy here, that the 5G is insane. Because in Shanghai, of course, things are more free—it's not the capital, it's not as sensitive. So a 6-hour livestream with no lags makes sense. But in Beijing, it doesn't make as much sense, right? Because this place is so sensitive—it's the capital. But there were still no lags. It was still an awesome livestream. The 5G here is insane. No other country does 5G like China.  

#### [Segment 12: Great Firewall rationale]  
Okay, here is something else that I have never heard anybody else talk about, but today I am going to jump right into it. I think a lot of people in the West don't understand why the great firewall exists. So let me explain. There's a lot of people in China who have had access to higher education, and there's a lot of people who have not had the same access. This is the same in the States, right? The people who have not had the same access as maybe some who live in the city are perhaps easily swayed.  

#### [Segment 13: Media influence parallels]  
If they were to access the Western internet, they could be influenced negatively about their own country and fed lies—just like Americans are fed lies by their own media. So many Youtubers come to China, and they make videos, and they say how shocked they were. Why are they shocked? It's because their entire life they were told that Chinese people are the enemy, and China is bad. China is poor. China is underdeveloped; there is nothing good here. But when they come here, they realize all of that is false.  

#### [Segment 14: Educational disparities and stability]  
If even Americans can be swayed by their own media—Western people in general—then of course, people from China who don't have a proper education would also be swayed. And things would end up very, very bad because there are so many people in China. And maybe you think, "Oh, well, they deserve to have access to the internet in the West." Sure, they deserve to have access to the facts—not to lies spread by the media.  

#### [Segment 15: Content creator's mission]  
Just like Speed and other Youtubers, I am here to show you what the real China looks like. Speed is a really influential figure—he has so many followers at such a young age. And I watch his livestreams, and I think that he handled everything with grace, and I think that he is an incredible young man. Speed, if you're watching this, you're awesome!  

#### [Segment 16: Personal growth and reflection]  
Before I moved to China, I viewed things as more black and white. But after living here and growing older and learning more, I now realize that there's far more gray in the world than there is black and white. So I encourage you to explore beyond the black and white that you know and search for the gray in between. I think that what you find may shock you—just like I was shocked.  

#### [Segment 17: Earthquake anecdote and sign-off]  
Thank you so much for joining me today. I threw this together really quickly because I just saw that Speed was here literally last night, so I said to myself, "I have to talk about this." And I literally just went to the dentist, and I'm filming this right after. So yeah, it was great to chat with you. Also, if you're still watching this: something crazy that happened to me last night at like 1:20 AM—I felt my bed shaking. I literally experienced an earthquake. I didn't think that earthquakes are really common in Beijing, and I talked to my husband. It seems like they're not because he's never experienced one in his entire life—and he's lived in Beijing his whole life. Wow, what a humbling experience. Have you ever experienced an earthquake? I definitely will be more prepared if there is a next time.  

#### [Segment 18: Call to action and content plans]

Also, real quick: let me know if you want to see more walks around the city. I haven't been going out too much—like I said, I have two young children, and I spend most of my time with him. So the only time I go out is really just for errands and also work. But if you want more content like this where I walk around and you can see the city, let me know—I'll definitely do it for you.
